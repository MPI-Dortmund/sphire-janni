 Version 0.2:
 - Added support for binning. In case you recorded your movies in super resolution
 mode, but later want to apply JANNI to binned images, you need to bin your images
 during training. This now happens when 'bin.txt' file is available in the directory that contains
 the super resolution movies. The file 'bin.txt' simply contains the binning factor (like 2 for 2x binning).
 - JANNI now allows to choose between two loss functions: mean squared error (mse) or mean absolute
 error (mae). The latter is the new default.
